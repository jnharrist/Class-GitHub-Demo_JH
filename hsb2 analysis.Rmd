```{r, include= FALSE}

hsb2 <- read_csv("hsb2.csv")

hsb2$ses <- factor(hsb2$ses, levels = 1:3, labels= c("low", "middle", "high"))

## Relationship of SES to Math Scores

This section will look at the relationship of socioeconomic status to math scores. I will begin with a summary of the math scores.

```{r}
hsb2 %>% 
  group_by(ses) %>%
  summarize(mean(math), median(math), sd(math), min(math), max(math))

```

Now let's look at a plot.

```{r}
hsb2 %>%
  group_by(ses) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = ses, y = math)) +
  geom_boxplot()

```
